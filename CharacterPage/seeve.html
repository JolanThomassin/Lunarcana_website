							<h1>Seeve</h1>
							<p>Jolan Thomassin</p>

						Seeve, the ghostly tsundere within the team, was a paradoxical blend of aggression and ethereal enigma. His spectral form crackled with an otherworldly intensity, an aggressive presence that belied a deeper, more guarded demeanor. Though he exuded an aura of aggression, his actions spoke of an underlying care for the team, often cloaked in cryptic and abrupt gestures.
						<br><br>
						Beneath his fierce exterior lay a hidden tenderness, revealed sporadically through moments of unspoken protection and guidance. His aggressive outbursts, rather than expressions of hostility, often served as a barrier, guarding a vulnerable core that harbored concern for his companions. While his words were sharp and laced with aggression, his actions hinted at a deeper sense of loyalty and a desire to protect those he held dear, even if it meant keeping them at arm's length.
						<br><br>
						Seeve's tsundere nature, a blend of aggressiveness and unspoken care, added a layer of complexity to the team dynamic. Despite his aggressive demeanor, his underlying intentions were woven with threads of loyalty and a silent dedication to the team's well-being. His journey toward understanding his own emotions, shrouded in cryptic expressions and abrupt gestures, mirrored a delicate balance between guarded protection and unspoken care for his companions.
