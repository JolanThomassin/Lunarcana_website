							<h1>Fuor</h1>
							<p>Jolan Thomassin</p>
						</header>
						<p>	
						Fuor, a street-smart child born amidst the chaos of bustling city alleys, had mastered the art of survival in the unforgiving streets. He was a lone wolf, a survivor who navigated the urban landscape with cunning and resilience. With no family to rely on, Fuor had become self-reliant at a young age, learning to scavenge for food, find shelter in hidden nooks, and evade the dangers that lurked in the shadows. His eyes held the wisdom of someone twice his age, a result of the harsh lessons learned in the streets. Fuor's resourcefulness was his greatest asset; he could negotiate for scraps, blend into crowds unnoticed, and vanish into the urban labyrinth when danger approached.
						<br><br>
						Oan encountered Fuor during one of his missions, finding the young street urchin caught in a web of trouble. Impressed by Fuor's survival instincts and street-smart savvy, Oan extended a helping hand, offering guidance and a chance for a different path. Initially wary, Fuor gradually opened up to Oan's offer of a new life. He joined Oan's team, his street-honed skills adding a unique edge to the group's capabilities. Fuor's ability to navigate urban landscapes, anticipate danger, and find solutions where others saw only obstacles became an invaluable asset. Despite his rough upbringing, Fuor's loyalty to the team grew, finding solace in the camaraderie and the sense of belonging that had eluded him in the streets. He learned the ways of the samurai, blending his street wisdom with the team's principles of honor and justice, becoming an integral part of their missions. Fuor's journey from the streets to the team was a testament to resilience and adaptability, proving that even the toughest of beginnings could lead to unexpected alliances and a chance for a new beginning.
