							<h1>Ive</h1>
							<p>Jolan Thomassin</p>
						</header>
						<p>
						Ive, the towering brother of Tow, stood at the heart of the team like an unyielding bastion of strength. His physical presence was both imposing and reassuring, a testament to his unwavering commitment to safeguarding those he held dear. Within the chaos of battle, while Tow gracefully maneuvered with agility, Ive stood as a stalwart defender, absorbing the brunt of attacks with an unshakeable resolve. His role extended beyond being a shield; he was a source of quiet inspiration, his very presence instilling a sense of security and unity among the team members.
						<br><br>
						Despite his formidable appearance, Ive's demeanor was remarkably gentle, a juxtaposition that mirrored his dedication to the well-being of the team. His actions, more than words ever could, spoke of loyalty and unwavering support, fostering an atmosphere of trust and solidarity. In moments of uncertainty or peril, Ive's reassuring presence became a beacon of stability, offering strength to his comrades and an unspoken assurance that they were never alone. His silent yet impactful contributions solidified his position not just as Tow's brother but as an irreplaceable cornerstone of the team, a symbol of resilience and steadfastness that guided them through their trials and triumphs.</p>
